README file for Couenne

Couenne (Convex Over- and Under ENvelopes for Nonlinear Estimation) is
a library for bound reduction, branching, and linearization cuts for
Mixed-integer, non-convex Programming problems. It comprises:

1) an expression library;
2) separation of linearization cuts;
3) branching rules;
4) bound tightening methods.


It is distributed on Coin-OR (http://www.coin-or.org) under the CPL
(Common Public License). The CPL is a license approved by the OSI
(Open Source Initiative), thus Couenne is OSI Certified Open Source
Software.


To use Couenne, run

$ Bonmin/experimental/NotConvex/boncouenne <instance.nl>

specifying a stub (.nl) as an input.


Couenne is maintained by Pietro Belotti (belotti@cmu.edu).

This project was initiated in 2004 by IBM and Carnegie Mellon
University as part of a joint effort to develop algorithms for MINLP.
