- check that auxiliary variable bounds are updated!
- read both lp and nlp solution from Bonmin; find cut once with both solutions and K times with lp solution
- improve convexification of x/y
- linear combination plus aux. vars into one single aux
- improve bounding box with upper bound
- add integrality to bound check
- order in convexifying x*y*z*...*(1/w)*(1/t)*...
- linear convexification has an acyclic structure where x are leaves
- recognition of quadratic forms
- q.f. partitioning into PD + nonconvex

- Write documentation...
