- rank in expressions for branching
- documentation
- improve convexification of x/y
- improve power convexification (find closest point in convex hull)
- linear combination plus aux. vars into one single aux - extend to constraints
- improve bounding box with upper bound
- add integrality to bound check
- order in convexifying x*y*z*...*(1/w)*(1/t)*...
- linear convexification has an acyclic structure where x are leaves
- recognition of quadratic forms
- q.f. partitioning into PD + nonconvex
